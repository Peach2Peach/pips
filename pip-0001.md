Title: Liquid integration with cross-chain compatibility proposal

## üéØ¬†Objective

Goal is to reduce transaction fees for peach user and for Peach when consolidating fee outputs without compromising the promise of offering a non-custodial and secure service.

On top, users should be able to fund an escrow and receive from it with any layer (on-chain, liquid, lightning)

These two requirements can be solved by introducing an escrow based on the liquid side-chain.

## üíß Why liquid?

In our research we explored many scaling solutions**: lightning, fedimints, cashu, liquid, custodial approach**. We immediately excluded the custodial approach as this is not peachy. While **cashu** and **fedimints** are certainly interesting solutions to scale bitcoin, we discard them as options for now due to their trade-offs, and albeit a budding but relatively small ecosystems.

### Considering lightning

We deeply looked into **lightning** as big parts of the infrastructures are already build and many wallets and solutions exist nowadays. Lightning in its pure form is, provided you do not use a custodial wallet, almost trust-less. However, doing escrow on lightning has many gotchas that make the experience a bad one or require more trust as we‚Äôd like to introduce.

#### The gotchas:

- lightning invoice expire after max. 14 days
- invoices with longer expiries lock up liquidity in all channels that make up the route while unsettled
- invoices with longer expiries might therefore not be routed by nodes that want to avoid this
- disputes arise and sometimes they take longer to resolve, even if both parties are honest. Fiat payment rails sometimes fail or they unfairly flag payments as suspicious.

#### The consequences:

- either we risk situations where one party leaves the trade empty handed
- or the escrow must temporarily hold custody of funds until a longer taking dispute is resolved

### Bringing it together

**Liquid**, while not without trade-offs can serve much more use cases. Yes, you could call it a fancy multi-sig, but many parties are involved, making the risk of collusion relatively low.

Because liquid is built on almost the same technical principles as bitcoin, it‚Äôs easier to integrate into our existing trading mechanisms. When then coupled with affordable **submarine swaps** (**atomic swaps)** , the friction to move on/off **lightning** is very low. Hence we consider [boltz.exchange](https://boltz.exchange/ "https://boltz.exchange/") which offer trust-less submarine swaps.

Hence we came up with this flow-chart.

## üë§ User stories

For buyer and seller each there are 4 possible paths to send and receive the bitcoin on 3 different layers.

### Seller

For the seller the funding screen will receive 2 new options, having 3 funding options in total:

1. bitcoin address
2. liquid address
3. lightning invoice

The seller is free to choose their preferred way of funding.

#### S1. seller sends BTC to an on-chain escrow

Same mechanism as currently active on peach. Seller sends bitcoin to an escrow address which will, once funded with 1 confirmation publish the sell offer.

üßê this mechanism might be replaced if S4. proofs as a viable alternative

#### S2. seller sends L-BTC to a liquid escrow address

The liquid network works very similarly to the bitcoin network. The same escrow mechanisms can be used.

> üßê Here we have an opportunity to improve the rules as well, possibly using FROST to change the thresholds from a 2-2 to a 2-3.

#### S3. seller pays a lightning invoice

The seller can fund an escrow by sending sats via the lightning network. The invoice will be paid to a swap exchange (e.g. [boltz.exchange](https://boltz.exchange/ "https://boltz.exchange/")). Atomic swaps are used which allows for trustless swaps ensuring, that the liquid escrow is being funded when the invoice settles on lightning.

Here swap fees apply which as the time of writing are 0.25%. For lower bitcoin amounts the total fees paid are still much cheaper than a pure on-chain transaction.

> üì± From a user perspective this will be as simple as seeing a lightning invoice as QR code for scanning, copyable invoice and link to open in lightning wallet. No need to manually go to [boltz.exchange](https://boltz.exchange/ "https://boltz.exchange/") to make the swap.

#### S4. sellers pays liquid escrow from on-chain

It is technically possible to swap and peg-in BTC for L-BTC. If there‚Äôs a way to not induce longer waiting times or higher fees, this path could possible replace S1. [boltz.exchange](https://boltz.exchange/ "https://boltz.exchange/") will also here soon offer services. Once they are live, we will reevaluate.

#### B1. buyer receives BTC from an on-chain escrow

This is the current mechanism in Peach. The buyer presents an on-chain address with matching signature to be paid to out from the escrow.

> üßê this mechanism might be replaced if S4. proofs as a viable alternative

#### B2. buyer receives L-BTC from a liquid escrow to their liquid wallet

The liquid network works very similarly to the bitcoin network. The same escrow mechanisms can be used. The buyer presents an liquid address with matching signature to be paid to out from the escrow.

The buyer always has the option to consolidate their L-BTC to an on-chain bitcoin address.

#### B3. buyer receives lightning sats from a liquid escrow through a submarine swap

The liquid escrow will be paid out to a liquid address the buyer controls. The buyer can then proceed with the swap to lightning. As long as a liquid wallet has not been integrated into the Peach app: for the user it will present itself as withdrawable balance for the trade. When withdrawing, the buyer provides a lightning invoice that will they will be paid out to.

Once a liquid wallet has been implemented the funds will appear in the wallet screen with the option to swap for lightning.

> üì± From a user perspective, it will be seamlessly integrated in the app. No need to manually go to [boltz.exchange](https://boltz.exchange/ "https://boltz.exchange/")

#### B4. buyer receives BTC from a liquid escrow via a peg-out/swap mechanism

The buyer always has the ability to receive bitcoin on-chain. This can be done through a direct peg-out or an atomic swap.

> üßê While transaction fees are cheap, we have here the opportunity to have the buyer automatically receive the L-BTC on liquid and automatically trigger the peg-out process. The message signing is automated which means buyers won‚Äôt be asked to sign a message.

Downside to this approach is that the buyer needs to be online (possibly have the app open) to initiate this step.

Once full liquid wallet support has been integrated, users have more control over when and how much BTC they‚Äôll move to on-chain if the automated solution is not desired.

## üó∫Ô∏è How to get there

The following core components need to be added or updated:

| **Status** | **Component** | **how** | **library/source** | **feasibility** | **gaps/issues identified** | **help needed** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| NEW | liquid escrow | our current on-chain escrow integration is powered by [bitcoinjs-lib](https://github.com/bitcoinjs/bitcoinjs-lib/ "https://github.com/bitcoinjs/bitcoinjs-lib/"), a fork of this library is [liquidjs-lib](https://github.com/vulpemventures/liquidjs-lib "https://github.com/vulpemventures/liquidjs-lib") which will make integration a simple procedure.<br/><br/>The script to create liquid escrows and interact with it will also be provided as FOSS.| [liquidjs-lib](https://github.com/vulpemventures/liquidjs-lib "https://github.com/vulpemventures/liquidjs-lib") | ‚úÖ |  | Questions regarding implementation details might arise, we might reach out to liquid dev community. |
| NEW | additional payout address settings | you‚Äôll receive the ability to set your preferred way of receiving sats out of escrow for any of the 3 layers (on-chain, liquid, lightning) | | ‚úÖ| | |
| UPDATE | message signing | if a buyer wants to receive to liquid, a message needs to be signed but using a liquid address.<br/><br/>Current message signing is utilizing [BIP137](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0137.mediawiki "https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0137.mediawiki") which does not work for all address types.<br/><br/> We will make use of [BIP322](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0322.mediawiki "https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0322.mediawiki") which works for any address type. That also means that users can receive to taproot and multisig addresses! | | ‚ùì due to swiss regulation, this functionality is a must-to-have to implement the whole concept. | Liquid wallets currently don‚Äôt seem to support message signing. | If you are a developer working on liquid wallets, consider adding sign/verify functionality.<br/><br/>If you are a user of peach and a liquid wallet, request the feature to be added. |
| NEW | payout to lightning | because invoices tend to expire, you cannot provide an invoice at start of a trade, but will be asked to provide when after the trade has concluded. You‚Äôll first receive the sats on a liquid address you control and then you can initiate a swap to lightning. | [boltz.exchange API](https://docs.boltz.exchange/v/api/ "https://docs.boltz.exchange/v/api/") | ‚úÖ | | |
| NEW | atomic swaps | Peach will interface with [boltz.exchange API](https://docs.boltz.exchange/v/api/ "https://docs.boltz.exchange/v/api/") to enable swaps between on-chain, liquid and lightning | [boltz.exchange API](https://docs.boltz.exchange/v/api/ "https://docs.boltz.exchange/v/api/") | ‚úÖ | | | | NEW | liquid wallet functionality | The Peach app is built on react-native and so far only javascript libraries are compatible, one of them being [liquid-js](https://github.com/vulpemventures/liquidjs-lib "https://github.com/vulpemventures/liquidjs-lib") (which will most likely be used for interacting with the escrow multisig as we do on-chain). We also looked into [GDK](https://docs.liquid.net/docs/blockstream-gdk "https://docs.liquid.net/docs/blockstream-gdk"), [libwally](https://wally.readthedocs.io/en/release_1.0.0/ "https://wally.readthedocs.io/en/release_1.0.0/") and some others. What is missing are react-native bindings, which we‚Äôd intend to build. **The react-native bindings will be built the FOSS way** and can be used to integrate into other react-native based projects (such as [BlueWallet](https://github.com/BlueWallet/BlueWallet/ "https://github.com/BlueWallet/BlueWallet/") and [BitcoinTribe](https://bitcointribe.app/ "https://bitcointribe.app/")) | - [liquid-js](https://github.com/vulpemventures/liquidjs-lib "https://github.com/vulpemventures/liquidjs-lib")<br/>- [GDK](https://docs.liquid.net/docs/blockstream-gdk "https://docs.liquid.net/docs/blockstream-gdk")<br/>- [libwally](https://wally.readthedocs.io/en/release_1.0.0/ "https://wally.readthedocs.io/en/release_1.0.0/") | groundwork required | Currently no JS/react-native bindings exist.<br/><br/>These need to be build to be used within Peach.| If you are an open-source react-native developer who is also looking building a liquid wallet. Reach out to us if you want to collaborate with us in an open source fashion. |
| NEW | lightning wallet functionality: | For lightning we consider [breez-sdk](https://breez.technology/sdk/ "https://breez.technology/sdk/"), lightning as a service. The user lightning node runs in the cloud but the user owns the keys and funds cannot be stolen. breez-sdk also comes with channel management, you can receive sats on lightning from the start and their liquidity service provider will open channels to you. Breez is implemented into a growing number of apps.<br/><br/>On the other hand, a full mobile client would grant users even more control but the device must be connected to the internet in order to receive and not risk losing funds due to getting malicious force closures. We therefore believe that using breez as a very good compromise. | [breez-sdk](https://breez.technology/sdk/ "https://breez.technology/sdk/") | ‚úÖ | | Questions regarding implementation details might arise, we would reach out to the breez-sdk community. |

### Open questions

#### _What to do with on-chain escrows?_

As can be seen in the graph and by reading through the user stories. The biggest hurdle might be going from Layer 2 to Liquid Layer 2 back and forth. Our concern is that either longer waiting times are induced or transaction costs being much higher or both.

However, making S4 and B4 replace S1 and B1 is desirable to ensure highest offer compatibility. Otherwise we could create situations where either the seller offers L2 and buyer wants to receive on L1 or the other way around. Trading under these conditions would cause surprises due to the aforementioned concerns.

We received word, that boltz.exchange is also here going to offer BTC<->L-BTC swaps which will require 1 confirmation. Using this swap service wouldn‚Äôt be mandatory as there are many other ways.

We are still evaluating this question and are open to suggestions.

#### _How is the compatibility with other wallets?_

The compatibility with on-chain bitcoin wallets stays the same as before. All common lightning wallets are also fully compatible as the only functions needed are send and receive.

Liquid wallets lack one core compatibility feature which is message signing. As Peach is operating under Swiss Regulations, buyers need to proof ownership of their receiving address by signing a message. [Blockstream Green](https://blockstream.com/green/ "https://blockstream.com/green/") has the interface but signing is not working. A [bug report has been opened](https://github.com/Blockstream/green_android/issues/192 "https://github.com/Blockstream/green_android/issues/192"). [Aqua wallet](https://jan3.zendesk.com/hc/en-us "https://jan3.zendesk.com/hc/en-us") does not support message signing at all right now.

If we find that message signing is not supported, a liquid wallet functionality is absolutely required within the Peach app and no external wallet can be used for receiving L-BTC through a trade.

#### _How will full wallet integration look like?_

We will provide external wallet support as the underlying mechanics by nature are mostly compatible with most wallets.

But additionally to make the experience as peachy as possible, full wallet integration is a must. All in one place. Many technicalities can also be automised such as funding, sending and receiving.

What we do not know yet is how the wallet will exactly look like within the app and which tech stack we will use.

For the UI, we want to show the full bitcoin balance as well as the balances of the individual layers. We will work towards making it as seamless as possible to send bitcoin that sits on one layer to another, possibly using submarine swaps and peg-in/out here as well.

#### _Which library for liquid to use?_

If you know of another project that can fit into the peach stack for liquid wallet functionality, we are eager to discover more options for liquid wallet integrations!
